Somewhere to recreate a community â€“ providing space for medical and legal services, safeguarding groups and other support. <br> Every food serving is made of fresh highly nutritious food freshly cooked with healthy ingredients accompanied with fresh herbs and condiments so our beneficiaries can make the food to their taste as we serve and we do this for 50p a meal including all ingredients, gas equipment and delivery",
  "It is sad news that we have to announce that Refugee Community Kitchen is suspending operations in Northern France due the coronavirus. <br> RCK is a COMMUNITY kitchen. It is about people supporting people, and so it is with heavy hearts we have made this decision. We have to protect our volunteers, the people we serve and the people in the surrounding area. <br> We will be reviewing the situation over the next 3 weeks, posting updates and will be ready to start up again as soon as viably possible. <br> Thank you for your continued support during this unprecedented times. <br> Love to you all",
